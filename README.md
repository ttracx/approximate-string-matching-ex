# Approximate String Matching VBO - Extended
Integration uses algorithms to compare different text strings to identify matches and intelligently decide if text is correct or as expected.

## About
Examples of how to implement Approximate Matching (fuzzy matching) algorithms as part of Blue Prism solution flows. This object includes examples of using Jaro-Winkler and Levenshtein algorithms Warning â€“ any use of approximate matching to make business process flow decisions should be tested extensively to ensure high accuracy of the resulting decisions.


## Benefits
* Uses algorithms to compare different text strings to help decide if they match
* Allows the robots to intelligently decide if text is correct or as expected
* Includes an action to find the nearest matching text out of multiple options
